In this particular project, we perform sentiment analysis on the Twitter US Airline dataset through machine learning (Logistic Regression & Random Forest). Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is simply a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. Companies can use sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction and obtain insightful customer feedback.Â
